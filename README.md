# Authorization app

Pet-project for learning in JavaFX and MySQL. 
You can authorize and save your data in database (see below).

Fixes: 1) Cyrillic and Latin are supported when filling in all fields. 2) It is now possible to log into the database (using the MySQL server)through the login window.

When clicking on buttons, windows now open without delay.
